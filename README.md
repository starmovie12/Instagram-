# 👑 InstaGrab

The **premium** Instagram toolkit — every downloader plus **caption + hashtag extraction** (the wedge that makes this more than another downloader).

Built with **Next.js 15 (App Router)**, deployable free on **Vercel**. Designed on the **gold editorial** system: warm paper canvas with a full dark mode, a seven-tier gold palette with one molten CTA gradient, and a three-font contract — **Fraunces** (display serif with gilded italics), **Instrument Sans** (body), **JetBrains Mono** (labels & numbers). Silk-smooth motion (golden-thread loading bar, mask reveals, coin-pop chips) with `prefers-reduced-motion` fallbacks.

- 📋 Auto clipboard prefill on the golden bar (only when permission already granted — never prompts)

Plus: 🔒 no login ever, public content only, rate-limited API, disclaimer footer, DMCA page.

**🌍 Multi-language:** the tool UI (paste bar, buttons, errors, result card) speaks
21 languages — English, हिन्दी, Español, Português, Bahasa Indonesia, العربية, Türkçe,
Français, Deutsch, Italiano, Русский, 日本語, 한국어, Tiếng Việt, ไทย, বাংলা, اردو, فارسی,
Bahasa Melayu, Polski, Nederlands. Picker in the nav (globe icon); choice persists in
`localStorage` (`ig-lang`) and auto-detects from the browser on first visit. Strings live
in `lib/i18n.tsx` (missing keys fall back to English). SEO prose stays English-first per
the PRD.

## Design system

Warm paper canvas (`#FBFAF7`) with a full dark theme (`#0A0906`), toggled via the sun/moon
button and saved in `localStorage` (`ig-theme`) — a FOUC-proof inline script applies it before
paint. A seven-tier gold palette (`--gold-100…700`) where the **molten gradient** is reserved
for the primary CTA, plus `--gold-ink` for accessible gold text. Type contract: **Fraunces**
(display, gilded italic for the one emphasized word), **Instrument Sans** (body),
**JetBrains Mono** (labels, numbers, chips). Tokens live in `app/tokens.css`; the motion
system (golden-thread loading, mask reveals, coin-pop) lives in `app/motion.css`.

## 🔧 When the extractor breaks (every 2–4 weeks — expected!)

Instagram rotates its internal `doc_id` deliberately. When extractions start failing:

1. Open Chrome DevTools → **Network** tab
2. Load any public reel page on instagram.com
3. Find the `graphql` request → copy the new `doc_id` from its form data
4. Paste it into **`lib/instagram-config.ts`** → commit → push (Vercel auto-deploys)

That's the whole fix for a rotated `doc_id`.

## 🛡️ Reliable extraction on Vercel (fallback API)

Instagram frequently blocks **data-center IPs** (Vercel/Cloudflare shared IPs) and returns
empty data no matter how fresh the `doc_id` is — this is the PRD's #1 technical risk, and
self-scraping from a free serverless IP is *not* reliable on its own. The extractor already
primes a session cookie to reduce this, but the guaranteed fix is a **fallback API**.

It's wired in and **automatic**: try Instagram directly first, and if that gets blocked,
fall back to a third-party API — but only once you configure it (otherwise nothing changes).

**Setup (Vercel → Project → Settings → Environment Variables):**

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| `FALLBACK_API_URL` | provider endpoint with a `{url}` or `{shortcode}` placeholder |
| `FALLBACK_API_KEY` | your API key |
| `FALLBACK_API_KEY_HEADER` | header name for the key (default `x-api-key`) |
| `USE_FALLBACK_API` | *(optional)* `true` to skip the direct attempt and always use the API |

**Example — ScrapeCreators** (free credits, named in the PRD):

```
FALLBACK_API_URL = https://api.scrapecreators.com/v1/instagram/post?url={url}
FALLBACK_API_KEY = <your key>
FALLBACK_API_KEY_HEADER = x-api-key
```

**Example — a RapidAPI Instagram downloader:**

```
FALLBACK_API_URL = https://<host>/media?shortcode={shortcode}
FALLBACK_API_KEY = <your rapidapi key>
FALLBACK_API_KEY_HEADER = x-rapidapi-key
```

The response normalizer in `lib/instagram-extractor.ts` understands the common provider
shapes (Instagram GraphQL, `{ media:[…] }`, and flat `video_url`/`image_url` fields), so most
providers work with no code change. Redeploy after setting the vars.

## Develop & deploy

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # local dev
npm run build    # production build
```

Deploy: push to GitHub → import repo in [Vercel](https://vercel.com) → done. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` env var once you have a domain.

## Monetization notes (from PRD)

- Day 1: Adsterra / Monetag (they approve downloader sites). Drop their script tag inside `<AdFrame>…</AdFrame>` (`components/AdFrame.tsx`) — every ad sits in a labeled, fixed-height frame so CLS stays 0. Slots: below the result card (280px) and on the homepage (110px).
- Later: AdSense **only on `/blog`** — never on tool pages.
- Keep popunders off initially; protect repeat traffic.

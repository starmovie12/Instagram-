      <h2>How to download an Instagram reel</h2>
      <p>Open the reel in Instagram, tap <strong>Share → Copy link</strong>, paste it in the bar above and press Download. You&apos;ll get every available quality listed — usually 1080p and 720p MP4 — plus the thumbnail as a JPG.</p>
      <h2>What makes this different</h2>
      <p>Most reel downloaders hand you a file and nothing else. InstaGrab fetches the <strong>whole post</strong>: the video, the complete caption ready to copy, every hashtag as a tappable chip, and any @mentions. If you save reels for reference or repost with credit, that text matters as much as the video.</p>
      <h2>Quality and watermarks</h2>
      <p>Files come straight from Instagram&apos;s own CDN, so quality is exactly what was uploaded — no re-compression, no watermark added by us. Audio is included in the MP4.</p>

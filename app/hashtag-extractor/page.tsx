      <h2>Research competitor hashtags in seconds</h2>
      <p>Found a post that&apos;s performing? Paste its link and every hashtag it uses appears as a chip. Tap one to copy it, or hit <strong>Copy all</strong> for the full space-separated set — ready to paste into your own draft.</p>
      <h2>Deduplicated and clean</h2>
      <p>Repeated tags are collapsed, order is preserved, and the count is shown so you know exactly how many tags the post uses (Instagram allows up to 30).</p>
      <h2>Build tag sets that work</h2>
      <p>Pull tags from three or four top posts in your niche, merge them, and cut to the 20&ndash;25 most relevant. That&apos;s a research workflow this tool turns into minutes.</p>

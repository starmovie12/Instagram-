      <h2>Original resolution, not a screenshot</h2>
      <p>Screenshots crop, compress and cap at your screen size. InstaGrab pulls the <strong>original file</strong> Instagram stores — often 1440px wide — with no recompression.</p>
      <h2>Carousels, complete</h2>
      <p>Paste a carousel link and you&apos;ll see every slide in a strip — download each one individually, in order, with clear numbering. No more &ldquo;it only saved the first photo.&rdquo;</p>
      <h2>Caption and tags come along</h2>
      <p>Like every InstaGrab tool, the photo arrives with its caption, hashtags and mentions ready to copy — useful for moodboards, credits and reposts with permission.</p>
    </ToolLanding>

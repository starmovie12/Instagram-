      <h2>How to save a story</h2>
      <p>Open the profile, tap the story, then copy the story link (share icon → Copy link) and paste it above. Videos save as MP4, photos as full-resolution JPG.</p>
      <h2>Anonymous by design</h2>
      <p>Because we fetch the story without any Instagram account, <strong>no view notification</strong> is ever sent. The uploader&apos;s view list never shows you.</p>
      <h2>The 24-hour rule</h2>
      <p>Stories expire exactly 24 hours after posting. If you get an &ldquo;expired&rdquo; message, the content is genuinely gone from Instagram&apos;s servers — save early.</p>

      <h2>Why a caption extractor?</h2>
      <p>Instagram doesn&apos;t let you select caption text in the app. Marketers transcribe competitor copy by hand; creators retype their own old captions. Paste the link above instead — the <strong>entire caption</strong> appears in a copy-ready panel, formatting intact.</p>
      <h2>What gets extracted</h2>
      <p>The full caption text with original line breaks and emoji, every hashtag separated out as individual chips, and every @mention. Copy the whole thing, just the tags, or a single handle.</p>
      <h2>Works on reels and posts</h2>
      <p>Any public post, reel or carousel link works. The media download buttons are right there too, if you want the file as well.</p>
    </ToolLanding>
